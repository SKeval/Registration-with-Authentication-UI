Designed the UI: Created a user interface that includes input fields for registration information such as username, email, password, and many more fields.

Implement user authentication: Once the user is registered, you'll need to create a login mechanism to authenticate their credentials. This typically involves checking the provided username/email and password against the stored credentials in the database.
